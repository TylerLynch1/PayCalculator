# Pay Calculator System

This Java project demonstrates the use of inheritance and polymorphism to calculate both regular and hazard pay for employees. It includes an abstract base class and two subclasses that override behavior as appropriate. A test driver class is also provided.

## 🛠 Features

- Object-oriented design using inheritance and method overriding.
- Demonstrates polymorphism through different pay computations.
- Clear encapsulation of different pay logic in separate subclasses.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
